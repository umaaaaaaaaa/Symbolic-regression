# Symbolic regression applied to the problem of stability of oil-water emulsions

Water-in-oil emulsions sometimes form after oil products are spilled. These emulsions, often called “chocolate mousse” or “mousse” by oil spill workers, can make the cleanup of oil spills very difficult. When water-in-oil emulsions form, the physical properties of oil changes dramatically. As an example, stable emulsions contain from 60 to 80% water, thus expanding the spilled material from two to five times the original volume. Most importantly, the viscosity of the oil typically increase by a factor of 500-1000. A liquid product is changed into a heavy, semi solid material. These emulsions are difficult
to recover with ordinary spill recovery equipment.


Various models are being investigated to determine the stability of oil-water emulsions depending on the following factors:
- D – density, g/ml,
- V – viscosity, MPa?s,
- R – resin content, %,
- A – asphaltene content, %
- S – paraffin content , %

The class of the resulting emulsion is then calculated as follows:

where the stability is the stability of the resulting water-in-oil type

The task was taken from the Handbook of Oil Spill Science and Technology.
